## Overview
Personal journal meets Google. POISE is a single-page app designed to save, map, and share memories (Point of interests,pictures,experience) and inspire users to make more. 
There are various places that we visit and believe it or google does not show all of them, say for example,you go on a hike and find this spot with an incredible view. You want to share that place with others,but google just shows a trail or just green area on map. How can you share this place this point on map?Hence POISE (Point of interest sharing and exploring).
